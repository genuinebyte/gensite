[Clone with submodules](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4438292)  
`git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:genuinebyte/gensite.git`

My website where I put things for the internet to see.
Inspired heavily by [passcod](https://passcod.name/).

Icon is inspired by the icon for [SourceHut](https://sourcehut.org/), which is
really just a white circle. I believe [this][circle] is the original icon, if
not then it is definitely one of [these][icon-tree].

[circle]: https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/core.sr.ht/tree/master/srht/static/icons/circle.svg
