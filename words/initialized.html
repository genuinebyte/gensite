			<p>Well hello there! Thanks for coming! I fought with myself long and hard about
			the first words that would be on this internet word deliverer, and those are
			the best I got, so you know the rest of them will be good. I hope that&#8217;s what
			you got out of it anyway.</p>
			
			<p>Awkward welcomes aside, I am genbyte -- Brad in formal circles (Bradley
			in formal squares) -- and this is my vertex of the internet. I&#8217;m a software
			developer, hardware playarounder, and a writer of sorts. I&#8217;ve long thought of
			building myself a rickety wall where I can pin up my projects and things, and I
			guess this is it.</p>
			
			<p>What you&#8217;ll find here will mostly be write-ups of projects I&#8217;ve done, or are
			doing, and the challenges I&#8217;ve faced along the way. I think mistakes are
			important, so I&#8217;ll be sure to write down all the stupid problems I create for
			myself.</p>
			
			<p>I have, what I think anyway, are some really interesting and novel ideas that I
			hope to be able to get to soon. Until then, consider this to be a sort of
			Initial Commit and expect more to come. Thanks for reading and goodbye for now.</p>
