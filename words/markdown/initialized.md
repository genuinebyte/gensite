Well hello there! Thanks for coming! I fought with myself long and hard about
the first words that would be on this internet word deliverer, and those are
the best I got, so you know the rest of them will be good. I hope that's what
you got out of it anyway.

Awkward welcomes aside, I am genbyte -- Brad in formal circles (Bradley
in formal squares) -- and this is my vertex of the internet. I'm a software
developer, hardware playarounder, and a writer of sorts. I've long thought of
building myself a rickety wall where I can pin up my projects and things, and I
guess this is it.

What you'll find here will mostly be write-ups of projects I've done, or are
doing, and the challenges I've faced along the way. I think mistakes are
important, so I'll be sure to write down all the stupid problems I create for
myself.

I have, what I think anyway, are some really interesting and novel ideas that I
hope to be able to get to soon. Until then, consider this to be a sort of
Initial Commit and expect more to come. Thanks for reading and goodbye for now.
