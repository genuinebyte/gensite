			<pre>50 million minds molested
because they couldn't bother to get their security tested.
Facebook is a modern titanic
sinking in the worlds biggest ocean after hitting a massive -
Zuckerberg sells you to the highest bidder, no mercy.
Mercer mines minds of many millions; a precursor.
Six4Three, the perverted company that skimmed bikini pics from me.

a VPN turned to data mining minors.

Swaying election results in a treasonous way;
leaving us with a leader that's got no ethical stay.
